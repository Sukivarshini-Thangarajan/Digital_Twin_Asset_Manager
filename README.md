# Digital_Twin_Asset_Manager
A cloud-native web application was developed to manage Digital Twin assets using AWS services.
The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted on Amazon S3.
The backend is powered by AWS Lambda functions exposed through Amazon API Gateway (REST API).
These functions enable:
    1.Listing assets stored in the S3 bucket
    2.Deleting selected assets
    3.Uploading new assets using pre-signed URLs
    4.HTTP methods GET, PUT, OPTIONS, and DELETE are utilized for seamless CRUD operations on the digital assets.
